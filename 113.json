At night we see the moon and the stars. You are able to see the words and sentences printed on this page. How is seeing made possible?"

With slight adjustment of the torch and the comb you will see a ray of light along the paper on the other side of the comb. Keep the comb and the torch steady. Place a strip of plane mirror in the path of the light ray (Fig. 13.1). What do you observe?"

If the wall is not white, fix a sheet of white paper on it. Reflected light will be seen to have many colours. How can you explain this? The mirror and water form a prism. As you learnt in Class VII, this breaks up the light into its colours, Splitting of light into its colours is known as dispersion of light. Rainbow is a natural phenomenon showing dispersion."

It is, therefore, important to understand its structure and working. The eye has a roughly spherical shape. The outer coat of the eye is white. It is tough so that it can protect the interior of the eye from accidents. Its transparent front part is called cornea (Fig. 13.14). Behind the cornea, we find a dark muscular structure called iris. In the iris, there is a small opening called the pupil. The size of the pupil is controlled by the iris. The iris is that part of eye which gives it its distinctive colour. When we say that a person has green eyes, we refer actually to the colour of the iris. The iris controls the amount of light entering into the eye. Let us see how."

Have a regular checkup—\n- If advised, use suitable spectacles.\n- Too little or too much light is bad for eyes. Insufficient light causes eyestrain and headaches. Too much light, like that of the Sun, a powerful lamp or a laser torch can injure the retina.\n- Do not look at the Sun or a powerful light directly.\n- Never rub your eyes. If particles of dust go into your eyes, wash your eyes with clean water. If there is no improvement go to a doctor.\n- Always read at the normal distance for vision. Do not read by bringing the book too close to your eyes or keeping it too far."
