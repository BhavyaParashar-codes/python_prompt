You are an AI model specialized in extracting structured educational content. From the given Class 8 NCERT Science chapter text, extract the following data in a structured JSON format. Include:
the chapter number and name
1.2.1. Topic names and number
1.2.2. Sub-topic headers
the content page number sequence number, type of content,
1.2.3. Paragraph, Images, Diagrams, tables, examples, and exercises
1.2.4. Activities, questions, External Sources or boxed facts under their respective sections
and finally the actual content

Do not add any extra interpretation or summary. If at some point the data of a particular section is not available, leave it blank instead of filling it with random values. Maintain the chapter-topic-subtopic hierarchy strictly. The answer must be in JSON format. The JSON should contain 6 major keys:

chapter name

chapter number

topics name and topic page number

sequence number

type of the content in the topic

internal name, actual content which was written
Include also: linked content types (e.g., Paragraphs, Activities, Tables, Images, Questions, etc.)




Prompt for time table:-
You are a helpful assistant. I have extracted structured chapter-wise and topic-wise content from four NCERT chapters using AI into a JSON/Excel format. Based on this structured data, I want you to create a detailed day-wise **study or teaching planner**.

Input Data: (structured content like chapter number, chapter name, topics under each chapter)

Constraint: The total number of days available for study/teaching will be provided by the user.

Objective:
1. Divide the total available days across the chapters and topics proportionally.
2. Ensure that each topic is assigned a duration (in hours or sessions).
3. Distribute the topics in a day-wise plan ensuring logical continuity (e.g., a chapter should not be scattered too much).
4. Include the chapter name, topic, estimated time, and day number in the final plan.
5. Ensure coverage of all content without skipping or altering any topic.

Output Format:
- Day 1:
  - Chapter 1: [Chapter Name]
    - Topic 1.1: [Topic Name] – [Duration]
    - Topic 1.2: [Topic Name] – [Duration]
Additional Rules:
- Prioritize completing one chapter before moving on to the next (unless content is too lengthy).
- If a topic is too long, you may split it across days.
- Ensure fair distribution of topics and time, keeping student attention span in mind.

Now ask the user:
Please enter the number of days you want to complete the study plan in.

Once the user gives the number of days, generate the full study/teaching planner using the input data.
